### Hey there! I'm Federica 👋

I'm a MSc student in Physics of the Earth System, University of Bologna. 

- 👩‍💻 I'm super into data analysis, visualization and machine learning. I'm always willing to learn more about data science, and its applications on ocean and atmospheric sciences. 
- 🔭 My Master's thesis work focuses on the estimation of the lateral export of biomass from the highly productive coastal regions to the open ocean. I developed an unsupervised learning framework based on K-means clustering to analyze a 18-year time series of satellite images of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, for three different regions.
- Some projects I worked on:
    - [Analysis of COVID-19 papers](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Meta_Analysis_of_COVID_papers) through the distributed computing framework Dask
    - [Bayesian inference of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness](https://github.com/RinaldiLuca/BayesianAnalysis_Covid19_Vaccines)
    - [Development and analysis of numerical methods for ocean and atmospheric dynamics](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean)
