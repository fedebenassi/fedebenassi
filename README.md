### Hey there! I'm Federica 👋

<!--
**fedebenassi/fedebenassi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I'm a MSc student in [Physics of the Earth System](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/PhysicsEarthSystem), University of Bologna. 
<!--

- 👩‍💻 I'm super into data analysis, visualization and machine learning. I'm always willing to learn more about data science, and its applications on ocean and atmospheric sciences. 
- 🪸 My Master's thesis work focuses on the estimation of the lateral export of biomass from the highly productive coastal regions to the open ocean. I developed an unsupervised learning framework based on K-means clustering to analyze a 18-year time series of satellite images of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, for three different regions (work in progress!). I am presenting my work at the EUMETSAT Meteorological Satellite Conference 2023 in Malmö (find the abstract [here](https://program-eumetsat2023.kuoni-congress.info/presentation/estimating-the-export-of-biomass-across-the-shelf-break-via-ai-applied-to-ocean-color-images)!)
- Some projects I worked on:
    - [Analysis of COVID-19 papers](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Meta_Analysis_of_COVID_papers) through the distributed computing framework Dask
    - [Bayesian inference of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness](https://github.com/RinaldiLuca/BayesianAnalysis_Covid19_Vaccines)
    - [Meteorological analysis of Storm Vaia](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Meteorological-analysis-of-Storm-Vaia) through a combination of model outputs, reanalysis, and meteorological stations data
    - [Development and analysis of numerical methods](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean) for ocean and atmospheric dynamics
